## Hi Alexandra, what led you into toy photography?

Art and toys have both played a significant role in my life. Toys, in particular, have always been very important to me, both growing up and as an adult. They’re a constant reminder of the universes I love and help keep me grounded, reminding me where I come from: a family of geeks, back when being a geek wasn’t “cool.” Alongside that, I’ve always had a passion for art, pop culture, and fantastic movies.

I discovered toy photography in 2017, and it turned out to be the perfect blend of all these passions—something just clicked. What started as a bit of fun turned into something more "official" in January 2019, when I created a dedicated Instagram account. Now, it has become a big and rewarding part of my life.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

Since July last year, I've been using a Sigma 105mm F2.8 Macro lens, and it has completely changed the way I approach photo shoots and stage my scenes. Aside from this lens, my setup is fairly simple. For lighting, I use a Ulanzi Pro 1 spotlight with a color filter, a Philips Living Colors mood light, and sometimes even colored Christmas tree lights to create interesting effects.

I got Photoshop and a drawing tablet. I always try to stay true to the original image as much as possible.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

I'm not a big fan of shooting outdoors, so the first thing I do when preparing for a photoshoot is close the blinds in the room to control the light. I start by developing the idea I have in mind, and once the concept is defined and refined, I focus on building the set. I create my own sets, add accessories, and position the figurine to bring my vision to life.

After setting the scene, I move on to finding the best angle and adjusting the lighting. I’ve learned that the way you frame a photo can completely change how it looks, so I try out a variety of angles to make sure I capture the best one while still sticking to my original idea. The same goes for lighting—I experiment with different setups, but my favorite is a bright but cold light combined with an oversaturated warm color.

Once I’m satisfied with the staging, lighting, and framing, I add some smoke for ambiance—using an e-cigarette to create the effect—and then take the final photo.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

Go for it and have fun with the process—don’t compare yourself to others. Watching tutorials or behind-the-scenes content online can be incredibly helpful, no matter if you’re a beginner or have been doing this for a while. Focus on your own creative journey, keep learning new things, and remember that enjoying yourself is the most important part.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

It's hard to pick just one, since there are so many talented toy photographers out there. But if I had to choose, I’d say [jasonbmichael](https://www.instagram.com/jasonbmichael) stands out for me. Our creative worlds are quite different, but I am amazed by every photo he releases. He creates his own dioramas, and his set-ups are fantastic—each scene is filled with atmosphere, dynamism, and often a sense of humor. His work feels truly complete, and he even shares behind-the-scenes content for everything, which makes it great for learning new tricks and techniques.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

It would be really hard to narrow it down to just five—let alone just one! But if I had to choose, I’d go with my latest purchase: the Nosferatu One:12 figure by Mezco. I love the character, and this figurine is absolutely perfect for creating creepy, atmospheric shots. It’s quickly become a favorite in my collection.
