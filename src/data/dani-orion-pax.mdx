## Hi Dani, what led you into toy photography?

Well, I started with LEGO around 2014. At first, they were simple photos taken with my phone, and little by little, I wanted more. After discovering that there was a whole world of toy photography on Instagram, I wanted to be part of it and improve the quality of my pictures. From there, I bought a DSLR and started experimenting!

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

The truth is, my equipment is very simple: I use a Nikon D5100, usually with the 18–55mm lens. When it comes to lighting, I try to use natural light as much as possible, but I often rely on small table lamps for support.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

If I’m being honest, 90% of my photos are improvised—they just happen. The truth is, having dioramas helps a lot. All the dioramas in my photos are made by me, and once the stage is set, taking the shot becomes much easier. Every now and then, I build a new one—there are always ideas bouncing around in my head.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

Yes—pay attention to the details. That’s what makes the difference.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

That's a good question! One of my favorites since I started has been [Captain_Kaos](https://www.instagram.com/x_captain_kaos_x/) and, of course, [sgtbananas](https://www.instagram.com/sgtbananas/). These days, there are so many great artists out there, like [blksrs](https://www.instagram.com/blksrs/), [Plasticaction](https://www.instagram.com/plasticaction/), [OLdesign](https://www.instagram.com/ol_design/), and [529_jay](https://www.instagram.com/529_jay/), just to name a few.

And in my country (Spain), I really admire the work of [@suppaduppa666](https://www.instagram.com/suppaduppa666) and [@martinmilantoys](https://www.instagram.com/martinmilantoys).

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

That’s a really tough question—I have so many figures that I just love! But if I had to choose, probably the Daft Punk S.H. Figuarts. They mean a lot to me. That said, I definitely have others that fascinate me just as much.
