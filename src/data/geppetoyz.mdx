## Hi Valentin, what led you into toy photography?

I started photography in 2014 as an extension of my passion for graphic design. Like most beginners, I spent the first few years taking photos of family and cats. In 2017, I decided to upgrade my skills and focus on model and glamour photography, which is still my main hobby—you can find my work on Instagram as [Animagyne](https://www.instagram.com/animagyne/).

Then, in the summer of 2018, watching the French web show **"20th Century Toys"** with Joe Hume and Ben Renaut inspired me to start buying toys and experimenting with toy photography. These days, I think toy photography is just my excuse to collect even more action figures!

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

My current gear includes a Sony A7 paired with a 90mm f/2.8 lens, along with a manual Canon 50mm f/1.2. For lighting, I use Lumecubes and Amaran Aputure lights, but I also make use of whatever I can find at home or in the studio—sometimes even the LED light on my phone comes in handy and can really save the day! I enjoy experimenting with different light sources to achieve the creative effects I’m aiming for in my shots.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

Sometimes I jot down ideas on my phone, but most of the time, inspiration strikes on the day of the shoot. My living room serves as my "studio" about 90% of the time, but when I’m photographing animals or dinosaurs, I prefer to go to the park to incorporate real natural settings into my shots.

My workflow is straightforward: I put the toys into action, set up the lighting and choose my gels, place the smoke machine, set up the camera, and then use the Fujifilm app on my phone to activate burst mode without touching the camera—then I just go for it! Once I’m happy with the results, I transfer the SD card to my computer, select the best shots, and process them in Capture One or Photoshop.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

I think it’s important to find inspiration not just within toy photography, but also from movies, comics, and classic photography. Gear and toys are not the most important elements. Learning how photography works on a technical level is the first step—far more important than retouching or editing. For example, I sometimes see photographers doing photo compositing without understanding how depth of field works, and to me, that just doesn’t make sense. Mastering the basics will always help you create stronger, more convincing images.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

I have to mention [Joe Hume](https://www.instagram.com/french_toy_love/), as he was the very first toy photographer I discovered—and he remains one of my favorites. His work has a truly “mystic” or “dreamy” quality that sets it apart. I’d also like to highlight [Monsterlaut](https://www.instagram.com/monsterlaut/) for his unique approach to color—his “color science” really gives his images a distinct look. Finally, [theOneCam](https://www.instagram.com/theOneCam/) impresses me with his mastery of composition; his attention to framing and detail makes every shot stand out.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

Well, I’m not a big collector, but if I were forced to choose just one figure, it would be Batman.
