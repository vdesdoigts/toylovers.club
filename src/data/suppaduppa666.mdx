## Hi David, what led you into toy photography?

I’ve always collected toys, but it was about ten years ago, when I was trying to create my own comic books, that I discovered a particularly helpful method from Paolo Rivera—a Marvel Comics artist—who photographed action figures to use as reference for drawing his panels. Inspired by this technique, I started doing the same for my own work. Although I eventually took a break from drawing, I realized I had ended up with dozens of photos of action figures.

I began sharing these pictures with funny captions on my personal Facebook page, and they quickly became popular among my friends. That led me to start posting on Flickr, then creating Facebook pages, and eventually moving to Instagram. To this day, I don’t think there’s been a single week where I haven’t shot a toy.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

My current gear includes a Sony A7 paired with a 90mm f/2.8 lens, along with a manual Canon 50mm f/1.2. For lighting, I use Lumecubes and Amaran Aputure lights, but I also make use of whatever I can find at home or in the studio—sometimes even the LED light on my phone comes in handy and can really save the day! I enjoy experimenting with different light sources to achieve the creative effects I’m aiming for in my shots.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

I use a lot of wires to make my toys appear suspended in the air. I love capturing a sense of movement in my pictures, and wires are incredibly helpful for building dynamic scenes. Once I’ve taken the shot, I simply remove the wires in Photoshop.

I also print out things—such as comic books or painted papers—to create backgrounds and set pieces, like rooms. These simple props can really enhance the storytelling and depth in my images.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

Have fun and keep at it. Sometimes you won’t feel inspired, but just pick up a figure and your camera—or even your phone—and start taking photos. Something will happen, and most of the time you’ll end up with a shot you like. But if you let a lack of inspiration or a bad mood keep you on the couch, you’ll likely drift away from the hobby sooner or later.

Also, don’t be afraid to use photo editing software like Photoshop. It’s easier than you might think and can really make your pictures stand out. There are hundreds of tutorials on YouTube, so you can learn a lot in just a few days!

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

My favorite has always been [Avanaut](https://www.instagram.com/Avanaut/). 10 years ago he made all the things the rest of us are discovering right now. I like a lot of new photographers like [noserain](https://www.instagram.com/noserain/), [plasticaction](https://www.instagram.com/noserain/) or [Felix Hernandez](https://www.instagram.com/hernandez_dreamphography/) too, I always enjoy their feeds.

One of my favorites too is not that famous but I love everything he does, [Cantinadanny](https://www.instagram.com/cantinadanny/).

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

If I had to keep only one toy it would be my Batman of the Kenner Super Powers line (1984). My alltime favorite.
