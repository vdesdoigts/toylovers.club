## Hi Sean, what led you into toy photography?

I've always enjoyed being creative. I worked as an airbrush artist about 20 years ago, fresh out of high school, and I enjoy drawing and painting in other mediums as well. I also like collecting toys and comics.

I was looking for a creative way to enjoy my toy collection as an adult when I came across some toy photographers on Instagram—and I knew I had to try it out. I started with my phone, then graduated to my first DSLR, and the obsession just grew from there.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

Currently, I shoot with a Canon T7i paired with a Sigma 50mm macro lens. For lighting, I use two LumeCube Airs and a pair of small Aputure LED panels, along with a softbox lighting kit I scored on Groupon. I also work with various modifiers—bounce cards, barn doors, snoots, and V-flats—to shape and control the light. And when I want to add a little extra atmosphere, I fire up the fog machine.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

My photo shoots often begin long before I pick up my camera—sometimes while I'm at work or even driving, an idea for a shot will suddenly come to me. I make sure to write it down then I spend some time brainstorming and refining the idea, thinking through the details and how I want to bring it to life.

Once I have a solid concept, I head to my garage and I start building the scene, using one of the many diorama pieces I've crafted over time. I always begin with the environment, setting the stage to match my vision. Before putting the figures into the scene, I pose them carefully at a table, making sure everything from their stances to their expressions fits the story I want to tell.

I make adjustments as I look at the setup through the camera to make sure I'm capturing the idea the way I envisioned and then I start snapping!

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

The best advice I can give is some of the first advice I heard regarding this amazing hobby. Be a good photographer who takes pictures of toys. No amount of post work can rescue a bad picture.

Learn about light and photography and how to take great photos and then apply that to toys. And take it slow, find your voice and style and hone in on the stories you want to tell. Most of all, have fun. It can be stressful but you have to keep it fun.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

I am really inspired by Trevor Williams. He demonstrates incredible skill in both lighting and framing, constantly setting a high standard for visual storytelling. What makes his work even more impressive is his willingness to openly share his setups and techniques with others. Through his detailed breakdowns and behind-the-scenes insights, I've learned a great deal and have been able to improve my own approach. His openness and mastery have truly influenced my development as a photographer.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

If I had to choose just one collectible to keep, it would definitely be the HasLab Sail Barge. Supporting that project was an incredible experience, and being part of the community that helped bring it to life felt very special. Beyond its impressive design and detail, the Sail Barge holds extra meaning for me because Return of the Jedi is my favorite Star Wars movie.
