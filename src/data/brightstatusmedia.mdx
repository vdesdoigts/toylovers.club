## Hi John, what led you into toy photography?

I’ve always been interested in photography and started out by taking photos of modified cars and car shows. When I got married, one of my brothers-in-law—an avid Funko Pop collector who frequently shares his collection on Instagram—inspired me to explore toy photography.

I began collecting Marvel Legends figures whenever I found them in the clearance aisle, as well as Star Wars Black Series figures. One evening, I decided to try photographing some of my figures, and I discovered how much I enjoyed it. Since then, toy photography has become a creative passion that combines my love for collecting and capturing images.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

At first, I was shooting with my Canon 5D Mark I paired with a Tokina 100mm f/2.8 macro lens, which allowed me to get really close to my figures without needing to crop the image. Later on, I upgraded to a Sony A7III and now use the Sony 90mm f/2.8 macro lens for even greater image quality and performance.

For lighting, I use a Lume Cube Air kit, which helps me create dynamic and dramatic looks in my photos.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

I start by setting up and posing my figures, making sure each one looks dynamic and expressive. After that, I add random diorama pieces to the background to fill in any empty spaces and create a more interesting scene.

Once everything is in place, I set up my lights to highlight the figures and bring the whole setup to life.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

My advice is to learn how to light the shot properly. Make sure white balance is done right. Do your best to pose the figure in a natural human like way. Learn to use practical effects instead of digital effects.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

I am really inspired by [Trevor Williams](https://www.instagram.com/onesix_shooter/). He demonstrates incredible skill in both lighting and framing, constantly setting a high standard for visual storytelling. What makes his work even more impressive is his willingness to openly share his setups and techniques with others. Through his detailed breakdowns and behind-the-scenes insights, I've learned a great deal and have been able to improve my own approach. His openness and mastery have truly influenced my development as a photographer.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

One toy that I would like to keep is Ant-Man. Because he’s supposed to be tiny, I can put him just about anywhere, and he blends in perfectly with his surroundings. This makes him a really fun and versatile figure to shoot in all sorts of creative setups.
