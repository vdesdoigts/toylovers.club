## Hi Chris, what led you into toy photography?

When my daughter was one or two years old, we got into the habit of setting up silly and elaborate scenes and dioramas with her toys after she went to bed, so she would find them when she woke up in the morning. This routine grew out of her own love for creating large setups, even at that young age, using everything from Star Wars figures to Playmobil, Fisher-Price, Lego, and more.

Eventually, I started taking photos of the scenes I set up and began posting them on Instagram. Soon after, I discovered a whole community of toy photographers there, and it really opened my eyes to what was possible—especially with outdoor toy photography.

At that time, the work of [x_captain_kaos_x](https://www.instagram.com/x_captain_kaos_x/), [sgtbananas](https://www.instagram.com/sgtbananas/), [swittpics](https://www.instagram.com/swittpics/) was extremely inspiring and eye-opening for me. Having always enjoyed outdoor nature photography, I realized how easy and rewarding it could be to incorporate toys into my nature shots. Discovering this community and these talented artists truly motivated me to experiment and to blend my love for the outdoors with my new passion for toy photography.

  I’ve always loved being at the ocean, no matter the season, and there’s
  something special about going for sunset and shooting photos there. I often
  think of it as my “church”—that peaceful place where I can reflect and
  recharge. Even on days when I’m not feeling particularly motivated to get
  outside and shoot, I always end up grateful that I made the effort. It’s just
  so cathartic.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

For my camera body, I use a Nikon D3500. These days, I primarily shoot with two lenses: the AF-S DX Micro NIKKOR 40mm f/2.8G and the Nikon AF-S NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8G. For indoor photography, I sometimes use a Lume Cube for lighting. While I don’t use it all the time, it’s definitely a key piece of my gear kit when I need some extra light.

I also love having some Atmosphere Aerosol on hand. It’s especially useful when shooting at sunset—the way the light reflects off the aerosol can help illuminate the figures and really make them stand out from the background, even pulling them out of silhouette.

For editing, I rely on Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop. I use Lightroom for tweaks and adjustments, and Photoshop for things like removing wires or stands, adding lightsaber effects, or even adding a second sun when I want to create that classic Tatooine look.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

For me, most shoots take place somewhere outdoors in nature. I usually gravitate toward beach settings—preferably near or at sunset—and especially spots with interesting rock formations. I also love wooded areas, and Cape Cod has some fantastic places that combine beautiful forests with its iconic beaches.

When I head out to shoot, it’s typically just me with a small camera bag and a bag of toys, hiking out to whatever spot I’ve chosen for that day. My daughter is usually in tow; she often helps me brainstorm ideas for shots, and she’s even started getting into photography herself.

Sometimes I set out with specific ideas in mind, but a lot of the time, I just get out there and start shooting, letting things unfold naturally—no pun intended. I’d say at least half of the shots I post are spontaneous creations, inspired by the surrounding landscape or whatever the sunset and sky are doing at that moment.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

My main advice is to just get out there and shoot, shoot, shoot. Have fun with it and don’t be afraid to experiment with different locations, angles, and setups. With digital photography, you have the freedom to take as many pictures as you want. Often, I’ll take 40–60 shots of one setup from different angles and focal lengths if I have the time. You’d be surprised how many worthwhile photos you can get from a single scene—especially if it’s something elaborate.

If all you have to start with is a camera phone, don’t hesitate to use it. That’s how I began! Try it out and see how much you enjoy it, then, if possible, consider stepping up to an entry-level DSLR or something similar—you don’t have to break the bank to take great photos.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

Well, first off, I have to admit that the list of photographers I follow is heavily Star Wars-specific, since it’s been my main focus as a photographer over the years. Of course, there are so many incredible artists out there who work in all kinds of different themes, and I honestly wish I had the time to follow even more of them!

As for photographers who are consistently putting out impressive work these days, [visual_approach_photo](https://www.instagram.com/visual_approach_photo/) is someone who has truly raised the bar when it comes to shooting The Star Wars Black Series line. I’m always psyched to see what he releases next—his work is instantly recognizable, and he brings something unique to every shot.

[SkeletonAstronaut](https://www.instagram.com/SkeletonAstronaut/) is another favorite of mine. His photos are fantastic—not only are they skillfully composed, but he also manages to project such a fun and playful mood through his work. That ability to convey joy and creativity is something that initially drew me to this hobby, and for me, it's a really important aspect of toy photography.

Lastly, I’d like to give a shoutout to [txcarlo](https://www.instagram.com/txcarlo/). His work with the 3.75" scale figures is truly amazing—absolutely cinematic in quality, with incredible dioramas. Every post feels like an epic event, and he consistently sets a high bar for what’s possible with this scale.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

If I had to keep only one toy, it would have to be my Star Wars The Vintage Collection Dengar figure from Hasbro. In my opinion, it’s still the best figure ever made—especially for a 3.75-inch scale. The level of detail and quality really make it stand out, and it’s definitely my favorite in the collection!
