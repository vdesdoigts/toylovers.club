## Hi Gibran, what led you into toy photography?

I really do love everything about pop culture and wanted to create some fan art based on my own version or interpretation of it, but unfortunately I can't draw. However, thanks to the internet, I found a way to express my love for pop culture through toy photography back in 2015.

Luckily, I discovered [eyeofuatu](https://www.instagram.com/eyeofuatu/), [Jazzer knightwing2110](https://www.instagram.com/knightwing2110/), and many others who have helped me grow my skill set.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

I use a mirrorless camera, the Lumix GX7. I’m just an enthusiast when it comes to photography, so there’s no particular reason why I chose a Micro Four Thirds camera over a DSLR—it’s simply what I had available.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

My work is heavily influenced by Alex Ross, so you’ll notice that many of my shots are intentionally overexposed in certain areas to mimic the distinctive visual style he’s known for.

For lighting, I usually rely on a single light source—typically an external flash—and sometimes add a couple of bouncers to shape the light as needed.

Right now, if I had to choose just one figure, it would be the Mezco Supreme Batman.
