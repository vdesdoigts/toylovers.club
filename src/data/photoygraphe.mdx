## Hi Sébastien, what led you into toy photography?

As an only child, I used action figures to live out amazing adventures and create imaginative worlds. This early enthusiasm eventually developed into a true passion. I started collecting action figures as a teenager, beginning with Spawn figures from McFarlane, then moving on to Dragon Ball, and nowadays, I enjoy collecting a bit of everything.

I used to take pictures of my figures just for fun, but soon realized there were others doing the same. I discovered incredible photos taken by passionate people from all over the world, which inspired me to take the leap in 2018 and officially join this great community.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

I use a Nikon D3500 camera with an AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm lens—the same camera I’ve used since I started. I really enjoy it because it allows me to shoot from different angles and gives me a lot of flexibility with my photography. Having multiple options for framing and composition is one of the things I like most about this setup.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

I generally work inside my apartment, setting up my shoots on the living room table.

First of all, I think it’s essential to be passionate about what you do. If you want to try toy photography, there are plenty of helpful websites—like [exclumagazine.com](https://exclumagazine.com/)—and many accounts that share behind-the-scenes content and useful tips for beginners.

Don’t hesitate to explore the work of other photographers and discover the different styles out there. Practice as much as you can, experiment, and don’t be afraid to try new things—you’ll soon find your own unique style. I’ve been doing this for over two years now, and I’m still learning new techniques all the time. That’s what makes it so exciting!

Finally, remember that art is very subjective, so create pictures that suit you and have fun with the process—that’s the best motivation you can have.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

This is a tough question because I can’t choose just one toy photographer—there are so many talented and inspiring artists out there. I feel especially connected to the French toy photography community, [#ToyPhotoFrenchForce](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/toyphotofrenchforce/), and I encourage everyone to check out their incredible work.

But if I had to pick just one photographer who inspires me right now, it would be [Eyeofuatu](https://www.instagram.com/eyeofuatu/). His mastery of color and light is truly impressive, and I really admire the way he brings a strong graphic quality to his photos.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

If I had to choose, I would pick four—the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles from NECA, which are absolutely amazing figures. They remind me so much of my childhood, and it’s always a pleasure to photograph them. I really enjoy the idea of keeping their adventures alive through my pictures.
