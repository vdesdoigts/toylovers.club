## Hi Hue, what led you into toy photography?

I’ve always been a storyteller, but several years at a previous job left me seeking a creative outlet, as my day-to-day was anything but creative. I needed to feel inspired, and one day I decided to photograph my son's toys.

Soon afterwards, I purchased my first Lego set, and two years later I have posted 1,900 images. I love shooting Lego—its scale is perfect for macro photography. Lately, I have started to shoot larger toys, including Transformers. I used to collect them for many years, and I’ve just started that up again with War for Cybertron. The toys are great and are much more based on the G1 designs, which I love.

## Could you share details about the gear and equipment behind your setup?

I use a Canon 70D with a Canon 10-16mm lens, along with a LitePanel Caliber and a smoke machine. I don’t really like to focus on the gear itself, but rather on how it’s used. Most of my work never goes to a computer—instead, I use my phone to color grade and add any effects to my shots.

I shoot mostly with in-camera practical effects, since I love how analog photography looks compared to digital effects. There’s something fun about seeing what’s possible without the use of Photoshop.

## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

A typical shoot involves setting up the environment—sand, snow, rocks, and so on. I build all of my sets from scratch. I have a collection of materials I routinely use, so creating an environment usually only takes a few minutes.

Afterwards, I grab some toys and create a little story with them. Maybe Luke is fighting a Wampa, or Cyclonus is being taken down by the Wreckers… it’s a little moment in time that I try to capture.

## What would you say to someone new to toy photography?

Shoot a lot. The more you shoot and experiment with materials, lighting, and environments, the better you will get. Also, see what other photographers are doing. You don’t have to spend a lot on camera gear. I would invest more in what you want to shoot than in what you're shooting with. Some artists only use a phone, and their work is great. A good artist can use any brush to create a masterpiece.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

There are so many great photographers I don’t want to single out any one person.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

That’s a difficult one. I’ve collected toys for most of my life and have amassed quite a stockpile. I am especially fond of Transformers. As a child of the ’80s, it’s what I grew up with and it’s something special to me. I think my favorite is the original G1 Optimus Prime. Till all are one!
