Gibran Risnutama is a toy photorapher from Jakarta, you can check his work on Instagram under the name [Monsterlaut](https://www.instagram.com/monsterlaut/).

## What led you into toy photography?

I really do love everything about pop culture and wanted to create some fan art based on my version or take of that, but unfortunately I can't draw. But, thanks to the internet, **I found a way to express my love towards pop culture through toygraphy back in the 2015**.

Luckily I found [eyeofuatu](https://www.instagram.com/eyeofuatu/), [Jazzer knightwing2110](https://www.instagram.com/knightwing2110/), and many more that helps me grow my skill set.

## What's your motivation?

At first it was just sharing my collection and deliver a so-so visuals but now I got my passion towards cinematic feel and wanted to discover more of it. **Toy photography is like an addiction to me**, but it is quite hard to find a motivation while I hit the art block.


## What's your gear?
I used a mirror less camera, Lumix GX7. I'm just an enthusiast on photography so there's no reason behind it why I'm choosing a M4/3 instead a DSLR


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

**My work is heavily influenced by Alex Ross.** So you'll find many of my shots were overexposed on some parts because I want to get close to what he did on the visuals.

So usually I only use 1 light source, an external flash, and sometimes a couple of bouncers.

## Any advice for a beginner?

Do it for yourself, like is just a number. Get fun with it, be wild, explore things. 


## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

There are many that inspires me at first like [rams_ands](https://www.instagram.com/rams_ands/), [ovic_yulkarnain](https://www.instagram.com/ovic_yulkarnain/), [noserain](https://www.instagram.com/noserain/) and [plasticaction](https://www.instagram.com/plasticaction/), but the one that really thought me about posing was [saintsyn](https://www.instagram.com/saintsyn/).

For my favorite right now is [ser__geo](https://www.instagram.com/ser__geo/)  but my all time favorite is [arthurjr](https://www.instagram.com/arthurjr/). His work really enjoyable, simple ideas brilliant set up.


## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

For the time being the figure would be **Mezco Supreme Batman**.
