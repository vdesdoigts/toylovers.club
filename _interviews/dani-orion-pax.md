Dani is a toy photographer based in Barcelona. He's a big fan of toyphoto, especially anime figures. He’s also a lover of animals, and he is vegan.


## What led you into toy photography?

Well, I started with lego about 2014, first they were simple photos with my phone and little by little I wanted more. **After discovering that there was a world in Instagram I wanted to be part** and improve the quality of my pictures. From there I bought a reflex and started playing!


## What’s your motivation?

Above all, the feelings. I love transmitting emotions through figures, making them feel, humanizing them. To me, they are alive through the camera.

## What’s your gear?

The truth is that my equipment is very simple : I use a Nikon D5100 and normally the 18-55 lens. When it comes to lighting, I try to use natural light as much as possible. But I am often helped by small table lamps.


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

If I have to be honest, 90% of my photos are improvised. They just arise. The truth is that it helps a lot to have dioramas — all the dioramas in my photos are made by me — once you have the stage it is easier to take the picture. Every so often I make a new one, I always have ideas in my head.

## Any advice for a beginner?

Yes, take care of the details. That makes the difference.


## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

It's a good question, one of my favorites since I started was [Captain_Kaos](https://www.instagram.com/x_captain_kaos_x/) and [sgtbananas](https://www.instagram.com/sgtbananas/). Currently there are many and very good ones, like [blksrs](https://www.instagram.com/blksrs/), [Plasticaction](https://www.instagram.com/plasticaction/), [OLdesign](https://www.instagram.com/ol_design/), [529_jay](https://www.instagram.com/529_jay/), etc.
And in my country (Spain) @suppaduppa666 and @martinmilantoys.


## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

That question is really difficult. **I have many figures that I simply love!** But possibly the Daft Punk SH Figuarts. They symbolize a lot to me. But for the record, I have others that also fascinate me.
