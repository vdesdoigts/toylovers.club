John grew up in the Philippines and moved to the United States when he was 17 and currently residing in Las Vegas Nevada.

## What led you into toy photography?

I was always interested in photography and started shooting modified cars and car shows. When I got married one of my bro in laws is a funko pop collector and also posts a lot of funko pop in his IG. 

**I started collecting Marvel Legends whenever I see one in the clearance area and also Star Wars Black Series.** And then one night I just tried shooting figs and enjoyed it.


## What’s your motivation?

Most of the time I really get motivated when I have a new figure. Sometimes when see them on movies and tv shows and wanted to reenact my favorites scenes.

## What’s your gear?

At first I was shooting with my Canon 5d mark 1 with the Tokina 100mm f2.8 macro lens so I can get really close without cropping. Then I upgraded to Sony A7III and with the Sony 90mm f2.8 macro lens. I also have a lume cube air kit that I use for my lighting.


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

I setup my figs for posing and then I just put random diorama pieces in the background to add something to the empty spaces. Then set up my lights.

## Any advice for a beginner?

My advice is to learn how to light the shot properly. Make sure white balance is done right. Do your best to pose the figure in a natural human like way. **Learn to use practical effects instead of digital effects.**

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

[Noserain](https://www.instagram.com/noserain) and [sgtbananas](https://www.instagram.com/sgtbananas) are really talented toy photographers. Their work are just phenomenal.


## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

**One toy that I would like to keep is Ant-Man.** Since he’s supposed to be tiny I can put him in about any place and he can blend in.
