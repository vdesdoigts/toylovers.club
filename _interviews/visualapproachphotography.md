## What led you into toy photography?

I’ve always enjoyed being creative, I worked as an airbrush artist about 20 years ago fresh out of high school, I enjoy drawing and painting in other mediums as well. I also like collecting toys and comics. 

**I was looking for a creative way to enjoy my toy collection as an adult** and I happened across some toy photographers on Instagram and I knew I needed to try it out. I started with my phone and then graduated to my first DSLR and the obsession grew.


## What’s your motivation?

I like to learn as much as I can about a subject that I’m passionate about and see how far I can take it. **The challenge of becoming a better story-teller, a better diorama maker and a better photographer is really what motivates me.**

## What’s your gear?

Currently I am using a Canon T7i with a Sigma 50 mm macro lens. I have two Lumecube Air and two Small Aputure LED panels. I also have a soft box lighting kit that I scored on Groupon. In addition to that I have various bounce cards, barn doors, snoots and V-flats that I use to shape the light. I also like to turn on the fog machine for some added atmosphere. 


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

The photo shoot typically starts at work or in the car when I have an idea hit me. I typically write it down and try to flesh it out or expand on it if needed. 

Then I head into the garage and start putting the scene together using one of the various diorama pieces I’ve made. I start with the environment and I typically pose the figures at a table in the garage before placing them in the scene. 

**I make adjustments as I look at the setup through the camera to make sure I’m capturing the idea the way I envisioned and then I start snapping!**

## Any advice for a beginner?

The best advice I can give is some of the first advice I heard regarding this amazing hobby. Be a good photographer who takes pictures of toys. **No amount of post work can rescue a bad picture.**

Learn about light and photography and how to take great photos and then apply that to toys. And take it slow, find your voice and style and hone in on the stories you want to tell. **Most of all, have fun.** It can be stressful but you have to keep it fun.

## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

I am really inspired by, [Trevor Williams](https://www.instagram.com/onesix_shooter/). Incredible lighting and framing, always sharing his setups and techniques. I’ve learned a great deal from his work. 


## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

If I had to keep one toy it would have to be the Haslab Sail Barge. It was a great experience supporting that project and **Return of the Jedi is my favorite Star Wars movie**.
