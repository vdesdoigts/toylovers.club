## What led you into toy photography?

I have been collecting toys since my childhood but 6 years ago, it became a passion that grew inside me... I started toy photography, at first just for fun with my phone but over the last four years I spent more and more time on this and now I guess it is a serious thing.
I dug a bit more into those hashtags and **found a whole community of passionate people doing the same thing I do**.


## What's your motivation?

Toy photography is an extension of what I see in pop culture, mostly movies because of these famous franchises that have been going on for the past few years. It is a manner to create new things that pop culture doesn't necessarily do, to pay tribute to heroes, and to shape new narratives in one single shot. 

**Like a Saiyan I never stop to try to learn new things and get better after each shot.** This community is built with so many talented people and there is always someone you want to approach and be as good as he is.

## What's your gear?

I am using a Nikon DSLR with a 40mm or 90mm lens depending on the scene I want to create. I always work with a tripod because I like to take my time, to find the right angle, the best light setup, the good posing. To light up all of this, I use some Lumecube and Aputure lights.


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

In 80% of my setup, I start by putting the room in the dark to avoid disturbing lights. I have a note on my phone with ideas. I choose the figure, the diorama or the background, some stuff to go with and after this, i spend most of the time to find the good pose — using stands, blutack, wires, magic... Next, I start my camera and try to find the good angle, move some of the background stuff. 

Final step, I choose my lights and try to find the good spot and give to my scene the ambiance I had in my mind. After taking between 20 or 60 shots, I choose the good one and I edit it on Photoshop. **And voilà!**

## Any advice for a beginner?

It’s a hobby, no pressure, no rush. **Don’t think about the "likes", prefer the quality to quantity**. One good shot a week is better than one crappy shot a day. Ask yourself this simple question: "Will I still like the shot I am trying to do in one month?".

Of course, failure is part of the process. But take your time before shooting, **observe around you**, how the light works, how real people are standing/running, how directors/artists use the frame to tell stories, pay attention to details, etc. One advice: TAKE. YOUR. TIME.


## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

I am a 1/12 photographer, and my favorite photographers shoot 1/6 scale figures. I try to get the quality of those guys with smaller figures. I really love the work of [bg_toyart](https://www.instagram.com/bg_toyart/), [uncannyfigures](https://www.instagram.com/uncannyfigures/), [ultraben235](https://www.instagram.com/ultraben235/), [EyeOfUatu](https://www.instagram.com/EyeOfUatu/), [cgerock](https://www.instagram.com/cgerock/), [capes.and.rifles](https://www.instagram.com/capes.and.rifles/).


## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

Impossible, I have too many pre orders on the way.
