Alexandra is from France, just outside of Paris. She studied to become a graphic designer and she work in the digital communication department of a big entertainment company. And toy photographer since January 2019.


## What led you into toy photography?

Art and toys. The latter have always been very important to me, growing up and as an adult. They are a constant reminder of the universes I love. They also keep me grounded and remind me where I come from : **a family of geeks, when geek wasn’t "cool"**. And I have a passion for art, for pop culture and fantastic movies.

I discovered Toy Photography in 2017 and it is a perfect mix of the above. Something clicked. I started just for fun and it became "official" in January 2019 when I created a dedicated Instagram account. It is now a big part of my life.

## What's your motivation?

Staging a scene. I want to make the figurine sublime and **tell a story in one single photo**. I think that a lot of it has to do with the atmosphere. Therefore, I pay a lot of attention to ambiance in my work : framing, lighting and "sweat". I try to spill my guts out for each photoshoot.

And I am very close to [#ToyPhotoFrenchForce](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/toyphotofrenchforce/) a group of **French toy photographers**. They share their point of view, they give me some advice and their support. They really help to keep me motivated. You should check their accounts.


## What's your gear?

I use a Sigma 105mm F2.8 Macro lens in July last year. It changed the way I was taking a photo shoot and how I was staging my photos.
Besides this lens, I don’t have much. I use an Ulanzi Pro 1 spotlight with a colour filter, a Philips Living Color mood light and a coloured Christmas tree light.

I got Photoshop and a drawing tablet a few weeks ago. I am trying to edit my work keeping it true to the original photo.


## What does a typical photo shooting look like?

I am not a big fan of outdoor shooting and the first thing I do is close the blinds of the room I take the photos in.

Then, I start developing the idea I have in mind and, once the idea is defined and refined, I work on the shooting set-up. **I create my own set, add accessories and the figurine.** Once this is done, I move on to the angle and the lights.

Depending on how you frame a photo, it will look completely different: I try to stick to my idea, but I try a lot of different angles to be sure I have the best one. And the same goes for lighting. I try a lot of different settings, but **I have a favourite one : a bright but cold light with an oversaturated warm colour.**

Once I feel good with the staging, the lights and the frame, I add some smoke for the ambiance — I use an e-cig — and I take the final photo.


## Any advice for a beginner?

Go for it, have fun doing it, **don’t compare yourself to others**. Watching tutorials or BTS online does help, whether you are a beginner or not.


## Who is your favorite toy photographer at the moment, or the one who inspires you the most?

It is hard to pick only one as there are a lot of talented toy photographers out there. But I would have to say [jasonbmichael](https://www.instagram.com/jasonbmichael). Our universes are far apart but I am amazed by every photo he releases. **He creates his own dioramas and his set-ups are fantastic : there is an atmosphere, it is dynamic and often funny.** His work is complete, and he make BTS for everything, it is great to learn new tricks.

## Finally, If you had to keep only one toy, which one would you choose?

It would really be hard to only keep 5, but one!?! I would have to go for my latest purchase: Nosferatu One:Twelve by Mezco. I love the character and it is a perfect figurine to create creepy atmospheres.
